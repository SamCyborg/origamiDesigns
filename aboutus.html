                 By formulating an adaptive webpage on Origami Arts which is a culturally and eugenically significant in Japan
                 and in most other countries as well, I want to introduce our Indian society to such art of beauty and rehabilitation(as 
                 this art has been known for its stress-relieving benefits). Following my entrepreneural instincts, I created this webpage 
                 to gain some exposure just out of curiosity(which might help me on my long-term goals).To be honest I would love to share 
                 the similar ideas I have with more people so as to make a community. Always on a look out for a fam! Reach out to me if 
                 you are interested!
